* preparation

	1. [x] live video for alignment and exposure settings
	2. [x] selection of ROI
	3. [x] adjustment of mean/range min/max for grayscale viewer
	4. [ ] selecting background correction option
	5. [x] synthesizing Brownian particles for testing functions
	6. [x] Add help menu with especially a cheatsheet for shortcuts

* tracking

	1. [x] waterfall update
	2. [ ] event counter (?)
	3. [ ] timer to show experiment progress
	4. [x] selecting particle of interest with cursor
	5. [x] recording a single particle track
	6. [ ] saving track (preferably on the screen) with flexible extra parameters (size,x,y,stdx,stdy, etc vs time)
	7. [x] live update of the track on screen
	8. [x] adjusting tracking parameters
	9. [ ] calculating track properties such as D or other live computations
	10.[ ] recording multiple tracks simultaneously
    11.[ ] follow two line cuts at the same time


* electrokinetic actuation

	1. [x] setting up function generator
	2. [x] programming waveforms such as ramps, etc
	3. [ ] generating specific waveform based on tracking coordinates for feedback control

* review

	1. [ ]  possibility of reviewing a track on a separate screen


* Bugs and Errors
    1. the waterfall window does not keep the grayscale adjustments after refreshing the GUI, and jumps back to the auto-contrast mode! (Issue resolved but adjusting the GUI refresh options for waterfall image update, Sanli, 10/5/17)

* Requested features and Recommendations
    1. [ ] make a special text pop-up method for viewing longer text such as for help, use example of messagewidget
    2. [ ] read out actual frame rate from the hamamatsu
